## React Cart Component

This is a simple cart component that renders cart items. The reason for making this was to practice some react and State using class based components.

## About

This mini-project renders 3 items, calculates item prices based on their quantity, and totals all prices of all items. Item quantities can be updated via 2 buttons. Updating an items quantity will update that items price and the total price of all items.

Item state is also stored locally using localstorage

## Get it running

```
git clone
npm i
npm start
```
